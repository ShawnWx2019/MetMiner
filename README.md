An Integrated Pipeline for Large-Scale Metabolomics Data Processing and Data Mining.

# Getting started

[English](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MetMiner/blob/main/README.md) \| [中文](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MetMiner/blob/main/README.CN.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

R version: `>4.1.1`

OS: `MacOS > 10.10`, `Win 7-11`, `Ubuntu 20.04`

*Only Ubuntu 20.04 has passed the test. Other Linux distributions need to be tested.*

# Dependence

LC-MS data analysis framwork: [**TidyMass**](https://www.tidymass.org/) developed by [Dr. Xiaotao Shen](https://www.shenxt.info/). [@Citation](#refer-anchor-1)

```r
if(!require(remotes)){
install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_gitlab("tidymass/tidymass")
```

Metabolomics Downstream Analysis toolkits: [**MDAtoolkits**](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MDAtoolkits/tree/master) 

```r
## install from github
suppressMessages(if (!require('MDAtoolkits')) install_github(repo = "ShawnWx2019/MDAtoolkits",ref = 'master'))
## two functions from another package called IMOtoolkits. will be intergreted with MDAtoolkits.
suppressMessages(if (!require('IMOtoolkits')) install_github(repo = "ShawnWx2019/IMOtoolkits"))
```

Untargeted metabolomics upstream analysis pipeline based on tidyMass: [**HPC-tidymass** ](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/HPC_tidymass) 

```r
##>  you can download this pipeline from github or just clone the repo to your server
##>  1.0 clone the repo to your server
git clone https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/HPC_tidymass.git

##> Run the initialization script to configure the runtime environment.

cd HPC_tidymass && chmod +x init.sh && bash init.sh

##> test
hpc-runTidymass -h
```

# Step 1. Upstream analysis

Here we refer to the process of obtaining the metabolomics data from LC-MS raw data to the generation of a metabolite accumulation matrix as <font color=blue>**「upstream data analysis data」**</font>. It includes processes such as <font color=green> 「raw data format conversion」, 「peak picking」, 「data cleaning」, and 「data normalization」</font>. In this pipeline, this part is typically performed by TidyMass or Compound Discoverer. If you have used other software for peak picking, you can refer to https://www.tidymass.org/start/create_mass_dataset/ to create a mass_dataset, which can then be used for subsequent analysis with TidyMass.

## 1.1 Pseudotargeted metabolomics

For pseudotargeted metabolomics, in the initial stage, HPLC experiments can be conducted using 5-10 QC (quality control) samples. Since the data volume is relatively small, and considering the completeness of commercial software databases, we recommend utilizing dedicated analysis software for peak detection and library searching. Alternatively, you can also opt to perform upstream analysis directly with TidyMass, followed by MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) selection to generate a TQMS (Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry) method.

If using commercial software, it is recommended to follow the instructions provided in the software's manual for step-by-step analysis. If using TidyMass, it is advised to refer to the tutorial available at https://www.tidymass.org/start/ and follow the provided guidelines. Alternatively, you can also execute the test scripts provided by the pipeline.
